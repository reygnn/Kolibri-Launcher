## Upcoming Features (In Progress / Next Up)

These are the features currently being worked on or planned for the next release.

- [ ] **Make Text Shadow Optional**
  - **Description:** Add a toggle in the settings to enable or disable the shadow effect on all homescreen text (clock, date, battery, and app labels).
  - **Goal:** Directly address the readability issue reported by users.
  - **Related Issue:** #3

- [ ] **Add Material You Color Picker for Text**
  - **Description:** Implement a new setting to allow users to choose the homescreen text color.
  - **Details:**
    - The picker will offer a curated palette, not a full color wheel.
    - It will dynamically pull colors from the user's current Material You theme (Primary, Secondary, etc.).
    - A few safe, static options (e.g., pure white, black) will also be included.
  - **Goal:** Give users meaningful customization options that are consistent with the system's aesthetic.
  - **Related Issue:** #3

## Future Ideas & Backlog

These are ideas that have been suggested or are being considered for the long-term. They are not currently in active development.

- [ ] **Investigate Widget Support**
  - **Description:** A user requested support for widgets, specifically mentioning KWGT.
  - **Status:** Currently **out of scope**.
  - **Reasoning:** Implementing the Android App Widget framework is a significant technical undertaking. More importantly, the absence of widgets is a core design decision to keep Kolibri Launcher minimalist, fast, and lightweight. This decision will be re-evaluated in the future, but is not planned for now.
  - **Related Issue:** #2

- [ ] **Advanced Theming Options**
  - **Description:** Explore further customization possibilities beyond text color.
