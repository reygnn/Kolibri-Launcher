    <h1>Privacy Policy for the "Kolibri Launcher" App</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 07, 2025</p>
    <p>Protecting your data is important to me. This app is a private hobby project and was developed to collect as little data as possible.</p>

    <h2>1. Controller and Contact Information</h2>
    <p>
        As a private individual based in Switzerland, I am responsible for this project. Since the app is also available to users in the European Union (EU), this privacy policy is guided by the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have any questions about data protection, you can reach me directly at:<br>
        <strong>Ulrich Kaufmann</strong><br>
        Switzerland<br>
        Email: reygnn@kolibri-launcher.ch<br>

    </p>

    <h2>2. Crash Reports to Improve the App</h2>
    <p>
        To keep the app stable and fix bugs quickly, Kolibri Launcher offers the option to send an anonymous report in the event of a crash.
    </p>
    <p>
        This feature is disabled by default. It only becomes active if you give your active and voluntary consent in the corresponding dialog box. The processing of these crash reports is based exclusively on your <strong>consent</strong> in accordance with Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR.
    </p>

    <h3>What data is sent upon consent?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your device model and the installed Android version.</li>
        <li>The version of Kolibri Launcher you are using.</li>
        <li>A purely technical error log (stack trace) that describes the code error.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is explicitly NOT sent?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>No personal data such as names, email addresses, device identifiers, or other personal information is sent.</li>
        <li>The reports are completely anonymous and do not allow any conclusions to be drawn about you or your individual usage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where is the data stored and processed?</h3>
    <p>
        The anonymous data is stored on the protected systems of our host, Netcup GmbH, with server location in Germany. We have concluded a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with our host, which ensures that the data is handled in accordance with GDPR requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the developer, I access this data from my location in Switzerland for the purpose of error analysis and correction. This data transfer from the EU to Switzerland is legally secured, as the EU Commission has determined that Switzerland has an adequate level of data protection (an "adequacy decision" pursuant to Art. 45 GDPR).
    </p>

    <h3>Data Retention Period</h3>
    <p>The anonymous crash reports are deleted as soon as the reported bug has been fixed, but no later than after one month.</p>

    <h3>Revocation of Your Consent</h3>
    <p>You can revoke your consent to send crash reports at any time for the future. To do this, simply disable the corresponding option ("Send crash reports") in the app's settings.</p>

    <h2>3. Other Data and Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        Beyond the voluntary crash reports described above, Kolibri Launcher does not collect, store, or process any personal or usage-related data. The app only requests the minimum Android permissions necessary for its core functionality.
    </p>
    
    <h2>4. Your Rights as a User</h2>
    <p>
        Under the GDPR, you have certain rights regarding your personal data. These include the right to access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. Since this app does not process personal data (except for the anonymous, voluntary crash reports), the direct exercise of these rights within the app is generally not applicable.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Note on Data Collection by App Stores</h2>
    <p>
        Please note that when you download and use the app from an app store (e.g., Google Play Store), the operator of that store also processes data as an independent controller. We have no influence on this data collection. For more information, please refer to the privacy policy of the respective app store operator.
